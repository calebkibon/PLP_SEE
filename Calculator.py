# Welcome to the Fun Calculator! 🎉
# We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss!

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimals too.
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
# Same trick here—using 'float()' for decimal magic! ✨
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Time to do some math! Let's compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# Add the two numbers (Yay! Addition is the first step to fun!)
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Subtract the second number from the first (Negative vibes, but necessary!)
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Multiply the two numbers (More bang for your buck! ✨)
product_result = num1 * num2

# Divide the first number by the second (Be careful with zero!)
# We'll assume the user is being responsible and not dividing by zero for now.
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Step 4: Show the user what we got! 🥳 Time for the big reveal!
print("Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")           # +
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  # -
print(f"Product: {product_result}")        # ×
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")      # ÷

# And that's it! You've just made a mini-calculator! 😎
